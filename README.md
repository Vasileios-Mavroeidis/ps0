# PS0 - Physical Security Ontology

An Ontological Framework for Data-Driven Physical Security and Insider Threat Detection

Abstract: This paper presents PS0, an ontological framework and a methodology for improving physical security and insider threat detection. PS0 can facilitate forensic data analysis and proactively mitigate insider threats by leveraging rule-based anomaly detection. In all too many cases, rule-based anomaly detection can detect deviations from organizational security policies. In addition, PS0 can be  considered a security provenance solution because of its ability to fully  reconstruct attack patterns. Provenance graphs can be further analyzed to identify deceptive actions and overcome analytical mistakes that can result in bad decision-making, such as false attribution. Moreover, the information can be used to enrich the  available intelligence (about  intrusion  attempts) that can form use cases for detecting and remediating limitations in the system,   such as loosely-coupled  provenance graphs that in  many cases indicate weaknesses in the physical security architecture.   Ultimately, validation of the framework through use cases demonstrates and proves that PS0 can improve an organization’s  security posture in terms of physical security and for insider threat detection.
